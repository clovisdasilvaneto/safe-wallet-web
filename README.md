## What was done

This branch contains the implementation for the Wrap/Unwrap ether as requested from the code challange.

- `WrappedEth/forms` - contains the forms that is used in the WrappedEth widget. So far we just have one but I like to keep this separation of concern in case we have different forms in this widget later.
- `WrappedEth/forms/ExchangeForm` - I've removed the `Wrap/Unwrap` markup from the `WrappedEth` component in order to have a better separation of concerns and also a better reusability of the form, since the logic is pretty much the same I've moved it to `forms/ExchangeForm` folder.
- `WrappedEth/hooks` - I've created this folder to put all the hooks that are being used in the `WrappedEth` widget.
- `WrappedEth/hooks/useSafeTransactionFlow` - I've moved this hook to be inside `hooks` folder. Note that I've also added two functions outside the useSafeTransactionFlow function, because it is also part of the `useSafeTransaction` but doesn't uses any state dependency, so its better to keep it outside the react layer.
- `WrappedEth/hooks/useWrappedBalances` - This hook returns the balances of `eth` and `weth`. This could be removed once I figure out how to also have the `weth` balance comming fmor the `useBalances` hook
- Note that I've also added a small user behavior on the widget, which is to have the buttons disabled by default until user adds some balance in the input. If he/her enters a invalid value (a value greater than his/her balance), the button is not enabled and the user would see a invalid feedback. ðŸ˜˜

**Points of improvement**

- The way we get the user WETH balance is by looking to the `getBalance` function from the WETH contract. I saw we have a `useBalances` that returns all the token balances of a given user (as I understood), the ideal case here, would be removing this explict WETH contract call from the code and grab this balance from the `useBalances` hook. I was not able to do so because the weth balance was not appearing in there, which might be because I'm using a different contract address in the sepolia network to test the wrap/unwrap
- The tests to verify the FE validation of the user balance was not updating the input for somereason, I've created all the tests and added a **TODO** comment in the ones which I was having problem to update the component using `fireEvent` -- I've also added a 'skip' command on the test cases with a TODO on top.

### Wrapping ether

To wrap ether, you need to enter some amount less or equal to your current ether balance from your safe wallet and click in the "Wrap" button. Please note the button will be disabled until you enter some valid amount. Ex: "0.0002"

### Unwrap ether

As you did for wrapping ether, you will need to enter some valid amount that is being showing in the "Your WETH balance is..." text, after that you click in the "Unwrap" button and the transaction flow to unwrap should start.

The default Safe web interface.
